# screen_lock

The project creates a Lock Screen (Just like we see on iPhone lock screen).
This project can be integrated in the projects, when One has to give the functionality
of Locks. 

The Lock screen works perfectly on all size iOS deveices (i.e iphone 4, 4s, 5, 5s, 5c, 6, 6S, 6plus) and all iPads.
**iOS version 8.0 or greater**. (I haven't tested on iOS 7).

Although the buttons drawn on the screen should be created programmtically, But
I have used the Storyboard and Autolayouts. The main purpose of the project
was to write a ready to use code that can be integrated into the iOS projects
to give lock screen functionality, **using Autolayouts and Objective C**.
